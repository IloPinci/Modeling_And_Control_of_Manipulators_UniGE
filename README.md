## Assignment 1 — Rotation Representations

### Overview
This assignment focuses on the mathematical foundations of 3D rotations. All representations are implemented from scratch in MATLAB, with validation utilities and a full frame-tree visualisation of a 7-DOF manipulator.

### Topics Covered

**Angle-Axis (Rodrigues' Formula)**  
`AngleAxisToRot.m` — Converts a rotation axis `h` and angle `θ` into a 3×3 rotation matrix using the Rodrigues formula. Handles the degenerate cases `θ = 0` (identity) and `h = 0` with a zero `θ`.

**Rotation Matrix Validation**  
`IsRotationMatrix.m` — Checks both the orthonormality condition (`Rᵀ R = I`) and the determinant condition (`det(R) = 1`) with a configurable tolerance.

**Rotation Matrix → Angle-Axis**  
`RotToAngleAxis.m` — Extracts `(h, θ)` from a rotation matrix. Handles all three cases:
- `θ ≈ 0`: axis is arbitrary, returns `[1; 0; 0]`
- `θ ≈ π`: recovers axis from `(R + I) / 2`
- General case: uses the skew-symmetric part `(R − Rᵀ) / 2sin(θ)`

**Eigenvector-Based Angle-Axis**  
`RotToAngleAxisEigen.m` — Alternative extraction using the eigendecomposition of `R`; the eigenvector corresponding to eigenvalue 1 is the rotation axis.

**Yaw-Pitch-Roll (ZYX Euler Angles)**  
`YPRToRot.m` / `RotToYPR.m` — Converts between YPR Euler angles `(ψ, θ, φ)` and rotation matrices. Detects and handles gimbal lock when `|θ| ≈ π/2`.

**Frame Tree Visualisation**  
`PlotRefFrames.m` — Builds and plots the full chain of reference frames for a 7-DOF manipulator using homogeneous transformations, rendered in 3D with RGB axes.

## Assignment 2 — Geometric & Kinematic Model


### Overview
This assignment implements a complete object-oriented geometric and kinematic model of a 7-DOF manipulator (6 revolute + 1 prismatic joint). It introduces the frame-tree data structure, direct kinematics, and the geometric Jacobian.

### Topics Covered

**Frame Tree — `BuildTree.m`**  
Constructs the `iTj_0` 3-D matrix (4×4×7) encoding the static transformation between consecutive frames at the zero configuration. Rotations are expressed as products of elementary rotations about Z, Y, X axes, and translations include the link lengths (in metres).

**Geometric Model — `geometricModel.m`**  
A MATLAB class (`handle`) with three core methods:

| Method | Description |
|---|---|
| `updateDirectGeometry(q)` | Updates all `iTj` matrices for a given joint configuration `q` by composing the static `iTj_0` with the joint actuation matrix (Rz for revolute, Tz for prismatic) |
| `getTransformWrtBase(start, end)` | Returns the homogeneous transform `sTe` between any two frames by chaining (or inverting) the relevant `iTj` matrices |

**Kinematic Model — `kinematicModel.m`**  
Computes the geometric Jacobian using the standard column-by-column formula:

- **Revolute joint j:** `Jv_j = z_j × (p_target − p_j)`, `Jω_j = z_j`
- **Prismatic joint j:** `Jv_j = z_j`, `Jω_j = 0`

Includes `checkJacobianNumerically()` which validates the analytical Jacobian against a finite-difference approximation using the SO(3) matrix logarithm.

**Simulation**  
Linearly interpolates joint positions from `qi` to `qf` over 10 seconds and plots the robot's motion using `plotManipulators.m`.

## Assignment 3 — Cartesian Control on the Franka Panda


### Overview
This assignment closes the loop: a full **resolved-rate Cartesian controller** that drives the **tool frame** (not just the end-effector) to a desired pose in 3D space. The controller was validated both in simulation and on a real **Franka Emika Panda** robot — and it worked perfectly.

### Topics Covered

**Tool Frame — `geometricModel.m` (extended)**  
The geometric model is extended with a rigid tool transformation `eTt` (end-effector → tool), enabling:
- `getToolTransformWrtBase()` — computes `bTt = bTe · eTt`

**Tool Jacobian — `kinematicModel.m` (extended)**  
Three Jacobian variants:

| Method | Target frame |
|---|---|
| `getJacobianOfEndEffectorWrtBase()` | End-effector |
| `getJacobianOfToolWrtBase()` | Tool tip |
| `getJacobianOfJointWrtBase(i)` | Any intermediate frame |

**Cartesian Error — `cartesianControl.m`**  
**Angle-Axis method** *(used in control)* — converts `tRg = bRtᵀ · bRg` to `(h, θ)` and computes the error as `bRt · (θ · h)`. Numerically stable at all orientations.

**Inverse Kinematics — SVD Pseudoinverse**  
Two pseudoinverse strategies are implemented as local functions:

```matlab
% Truncated SVD pseudoinverse (discards small singular values)
q_dot = svdPinvApprox(J) * x_dot_ref;

% Damped least-squares (smooth behaviour near singularities)
q_dot = svdDampedPinvApprox(J, lambda) * x_dot_ref;
```

**Kinematic Simulation — `KinematicSimulation.m`**  
Single Euler integration step with joint limit enforcement:
```
q ← clip( q + dt · q̇,  q_min,  q_max )
```

**Control Loop**  
The resolved-rate loop runs at 100 samples over 15 seconds:
1. Compute tool pose `bTt`
2. Compute Cartesian error `x_dot = [K_l · Δp; K_a · Δφ]`
3. Compute joint velocities via damped pseudoinverse: `q_dot = J# · x_dot`
4. Integrate: `q ← q + dt · q_dot`
5. Stop when `‖Δp‖ < 0.01` and `‖Δφ‖ < 0.01`

**Velocity Analysis (Ex 2.5)**  
Tool velocity is computed two ways and verified to match:
- *Method 1:* Rigid-body formula — `v_t = v_e + ωₑ × b_r_et`
- *Method 2:* Direct tool Jacobian — `x_dot_t = J_tool · q_dot`


### Demo — Real Franka Panda Robot

The controller was deployed on a real **Franka Emika Panda** and successfully drove the tool to the target pose as seen below:
